# ECE244---Programming-Fundamentals

### Lab Overview
Lab 1 - Debugging Code using Breakpoints and Debugging tools in NetBeans
Part 1: Finding a bug with hello.cpp
Part 2: Finding a run-time bug with harmonic.cpp
Part 3: Finding a run-time bug with convert.cpp

**Lab 2** - **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**
- Using Classes, Objects, and Methods to build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game

**Lab 3** - **Command Line Parser**
- Programmed the Command Line Parser by using:\
1. C++ I/O streams, including Error Handling\
2. Classes with constructors, accessors and mutators\
3. Dynamic Allocation and De-allocation of One-dimensional arrays

**Lab 4** - **Linked List**
- Programmed a Command Parser that create shapes, create groups of shapes, move shapes across groups, and delete shapes/groups.\
- Programmed the Command Line Parser by using:\
1. C++ I/O streams, including Error Handling\
2. Classes with constructors, accessors and mutators
3. Linked Lists

**Lab 5** - **Inheritance and Virtual Functions**
- Provided with a "high-level" decision making framework of the program that implements a database of shapes in the form of an object file.\
- Added new functionalities by creating new Clasess(Circles, Triangle, and Rectangle) through virtual functions without changing the code of the framework.
